# Tissue Patches Configuration
# Sample-specific tissue overrides for cases where:
# 1. Tissue is missing from metadata
# 2. Tissue value needs correction based on manual research
# 3. Entire bioproject has uniform tissue type

# Per-sample overrides
# Format: run_accession: canonical_tissue

  This file contains manual tissue annotations for samples where:
  - The metadata.tsv tissue field is empty
  - The tissue field contains incorrect/ambiguous values
  - Manual research revealed the true tissue type
  
  Always document the source of information in _sources section.
  
  ## Remaining Empty (5 samples)
  
  PRJNA172020 (4 samples): Mixed tissues - study includes pupae, larvae, 
  and various dissected adult organs (malpighian tubules, etc.). Cannot 
  assign a single tissue type to entire bioproject.
  
  1 additional sample: Unknown origin, likely from a multi-tissue study.
  
  Coverage: 99.9% (7,265/7,270 samples normalized as of 2026-02-01)
