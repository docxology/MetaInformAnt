    # Directory where per-species merge outputs are located
    # Note: amalgkit usually looks in {out_dir}/merge, but for cross-species
    # we might need to symlink or specify paths. 
    # Since amalgkit structure expects species subdirs, we'll need to 
    # structure the input directory correctly.
