# METAINFORMANT Long-Read Config: PacBio HiFi (CCS)
# Optimized for PacBio HiFi / Circular Consensus Sequencing
#
# HiFi characteristics:
# - Very high accuracy (>Q20, typically Q30+)
# - Read lengths 10-25 kb (shorter than ONT ultra-long)
# - CCS reads from Sequel II / Revio systems
# - 5mC detection via kinetics (IpdRatio)
