# AI Agents in Output Management

This document outlines AI assistance in developing MetaInformAnt's output directory structure and management policies.

## AI Contributions

### Output Architecture
**Code Assistant Agent** designed:
- Repository-level output directory organization for program-generated files only
- Strict separation: `output/` for auto-generated files, `docs/` for documentation
- Output management policies preventing manual file creation
- File I/O utility integration patterns
- Path handling and containment validation

### Management Policies
**Documentation Agent** assisted with:
- Clear distinction between program outputs and documentation
- Policy enforcement: **no manually created files in output/**
- Repository rules and conventions for output vs. documentation
- Integration guidelines for auto-generated outputs only
- Cleanup and maintenance recommendations for ephemeral data

### Quality Assurance
**Code Assistant Agent** contributed to:
- Output path validation and security
- File I/O operation verification
- Performance considerations for large outputs
- Integration testing for output workflows
- Enforcement of "auto-generated only" policy

## Development Approach

- **Strict Separation**: Auto-generated outputs in `output/`, documentation in `docs/`
- **Repository Structure**: Clear output organization for program files only
- **Security Focus**: Path containment and validation
- **Performance Awareness**: Optimized for large-scale biological outputs
- **Policy Enforcement**: No manual documentation or reports in `output/`

## Policy Evolution

### Initial Design
- Output directory created for all program-generated files
- Integration with `metainformant.core.io` and `metainformant.core.paths`
- Ephemeral data storage with reproducibility focus

### Policy Refinement (Nov 2025)
- **Strict enforcement**: Only auto-generated files in `output/`
- **No exceptions**: All manually created documentation moved to `docs/`
- **Clear rules**: `.cursorrules` enforcement at directory level
- **Cleanup**: Removed all status reports, summaries, and manually created `.md` files

### Current Status
- ✅ All manually created documentation removed from `output/`
- ✅ Policy documented in `output/README.md` and `output/.cursorrules`
- ✅ Clear distinction: program outputs vs. documentation
- ✅ Integration patterns follow strict separation

## Quality Assurance

- Human oversight ensures output security and correctness
- AI assistance accelerates development while maintaining standards
- Comprehensive testing validates output management functionality
- **Strict policy**: AI agents never create documentation files in `output/`

## Usage by AI Agents

### Correct Usage ✅

```python
# Write program-generated output
from metainformant.core import io

# Quantification results
io.dump_json(quant_data, "output/amalgkit/species/quant/sample.json")

# Analysis plots
plot.savefig("output/gwas/plots/manhattan.png")

# Execution logs
logging.basicConfig(filename="output/workflow.log")
```

### Incorrect Usage ❌

```python
# NEVER write documentation to output/
with open("output/ANALYSIS_REPORT.md", "w") as f:  # WRONG!
    f.write("# Analysis Summary...")

# NEVER create status reports in output/
with open("output/STATUS_SUMMARY.md", "w") as f:  # WRONG!
    f.write("## Current Status...")

# Documentation belongs in docs/
with open("docs/rna/analysis_results.md", "w") as f:  # CORRECT!
    f.write("# RNA-seq Analysis Results...")
```

## Exception: Auto-Generated Documentation

**Only exception** - Files generated by external tools:
- `amalgkit.report.md` - Generated by amalgkit CLI tool ✅
- `ncbi_dataset_api_extracted/README.md` - Generated by NCBI tools ✅

These are auto-generated by external programs, not manually created.

This output management system provides a solid foundation for MetaInformAnt's data processing workflows while maintaining clear separation between program outputs and documentation.
