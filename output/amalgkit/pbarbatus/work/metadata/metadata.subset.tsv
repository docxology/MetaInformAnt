A cDNA library was made from the total RNA extractions, and mRNA was enriched for using poly-A pulldown. Illumina pair-end libraries were constructed. Each sample is pooled 3 brains. There are 3 replicate samples (1-3) from each of 6 colones (1-6). Samples are named """"colony#_replicate#"""". So for example, Sample 3_1 is replicate #1 from colony #3.
