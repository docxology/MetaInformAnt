# ⚡ Parallel Batch Processing: RUNNING

**Started**: October 28, 2025, 8:43 AM  
**Status**: 🚀 **PARALLEL PROCESSING ACTIVE**  
**Speedup**: **2.5X FASTER** than sequential

---

## 🎯 Performance Optimization

### Bottleneck Analysis

**Sequential Processing** (old method):
- Download: 10-18 minutes (85-90% of time) ⚠️ **BOTTLENECK**
- Quantify: 2-3 minutes (10-15% of time)
- Total per sample: ~15 minutes
- **81 samples: 20.3 hours**

**Parallel Processing** (new method):
- 5 concurrent downloads: 15 minutes (parallel)
- Quantify as completed: 3 minutes each
- **81 samples: ~8 hours** ⚡

### Key Improvements

✅ **5 concurrent downloads** - Maximize network throughput  
✅ **2 concurrent quantifications** - Optimize CPU usage  
✅ **Immediate cleanup** - Free space as soon as quantified  
✅ **Automatic blocking detection** - Kill stale processes  
✅ **Thread pool execution** - Efficient resource management

## 📊 Current Status

**Running Processes** (example from 8:43 AM):
```
prefetch SRR14740489  ← Download 1
prefetch SRR14740492  ← Download 2
prefetch SRR14740493  ← Download 3
prefetch SRR14740494  ← Download 4
prefetch SRR14740495  ← Download 5
```

**Progress**:
- Completed: 2/83 samples
- Processing: 5+ concurrent
- Remaining: 81 samples
- Est. completion: ~8 hours from start

## 💾 Storage Impact

| Method | Peak Storage | Notes |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| Sequential | 5GB | 1 sample at a time |
| **Parallel (5)** | **25GB** | **5 samples max** |
| Still manageable | ✅ | Well under typical free space |

**Cleanup Strategy**:
- FASTQs deleted immediately after quantification
- Never more than 5 samples on disk simultaneously
- Final storage: only ~90MB quantification results

## 📈 Monitoring

### Real-time Log
```bash
cd /Users/4d/Documents/GitHub/metainformant
tail -f output/amalgkit/pbarbatus/batch_parallel.log
```

### Check Active Downloads
```bash
ps aux | grep prefetch | grep -v grep | wc -l
# Should show ~5 concurrent
```

### Check Quantified Samples
```bash
ls output/amalgkit/pbarbatus/work/quant/*/abundance.tsv | wc -l
# Increases as samples complete
```

### View Detailed Progress
```bash
# Latest JSON log
ls -t output/amalgkit/pbarbatus/batch_parallel_log_*.json | head -1 | xargs cat | python3 -m json.tool | tail -100
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Configuration

```python
MAX_CONCURRENT_DOWNLOADS = 5  # Parallel downloads
MAX_CONCURRENT_QUANTS = 2     # Parallel quantifications
DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT = 1800       # 30 minutes per download
QUANT_TIMEOUT = 600          # 10 minutes per quantification
```

### Thread Pool Architecture

```
ThreadPoolExecutor (max_workers=5)
├── Thread 1: Download SRR14740489 → Quantify → Cleanup
├── Thread 2: Download SRR14740490 → Quantify → Cleanup
├── Thread 3: Download SRR14740491 → Quantify → Cleanup
├── Thread 4: Download SRR14740492 → Quantify → Cleanup
└── Thread 5: Download SRR14740493 → Quantify → Cleanup
     ↓
As each completes, next sample starts automatically
```

### Pipeline Per Sample

```
1. Kill blocking processes (if any)
2. Download FASTQ (prefetch + fasterq-dump + compress)
3. Quantify with kallisto (immediately after download)
4. Cleanup FASTQ (free ~5GB)
5. Log results to JSON
```

---

## 🛑 Stop/Restart Commands

### Stop Parallel Processing
```bash
cd /Users/4d/Documents/GitHub/metainformant

# Kill parallel batch
kill $(cat output/amalgkit/pbarbatus/batch_parallel_pid.txt)

# Kill any downloads
pkill -f "prefetch SRR"
pkill -f "fasterq-dump"
```

### Restart (Automatic Resume)
```bash
cd /Users/4d/Documents/GitHub/metainformant

# Restart - automatically skips completed samples
python3 output/amalgkit/pbarbatus/batch_parallel.py > output/amalgkit/pbarbatus/batch_parallel.log 2>&1 &
echo $! > output/amalgkit/pbarbatus/batch_parallel_pid.txt
```

## ✅ Success Indicators

Look for these in logs:

```
📥 [SRR14740489] Starting download...
   [SRR14740489] Prefetch...
   [SRR14740489] Converting to FASTQ...
   [SRR14740489] Compressing...
✅ [SRR14740489] Download complete

📈 [SRR14740489] Starting quantification...
✅ [SRR14740489] Quantification complete: 18592/20672 expressed

🗑️  [SRR14740489] Freed 4.35GB

📊 Progress: 3/81 | Success: 3 | Failed: 0
```

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If Downloads Seem Slow

Check concurrent count:
```bash
ps aux | grep prefetch | wc -l
# Should be ~5
```

If less than 5, some may have failed. Check log:
```bash
tail -100 output/amalgkit/pbarbatus/batch_parallel.log
```

### If Stuck

Parallel processing is **safe to restart**:
- Already quantified samples automatically skipped
- Can restart without losing progress
- All completed work preserved in quant/ directory

---

## 📊 After Completion

When all 83 samples complete:

### 1. Verify
```bash
ls output/amalgkit/pbarbatus/work/quant/SRR*/abundance.tsv | wc -l
# Should show: 83
```

### 2. Merge into Matrix
```bash
cd /Users/4d/Documents/GitHub/metainformant
PYTHONPATH=src python3 << 'EOF'
from metainformant.rna import amalgkit
from pathlib import Path

base = Path("output/amalgkit/pbarbatus")
params = {"out_dir": str(base / "work"), "threads": 6}

amalgkit.merge(params, work_dir=str(base), log_dir=str(base / "logs"), check=False)
print("✅ Merged! output/amalgkit/pbarbatus/merged/merged_abundance.tsv")
EOF
```

### 3. Analyze
```python
import pandas as pd
expr = pd.read_csv("output/amalgkit/pbarbatus/merged/merged_abundance.tsv", sep='\t', index_col=0)
print(f"Expression matrix: {expr.shape[0]} transcripts × {expr.shape[1]} samples")
```
