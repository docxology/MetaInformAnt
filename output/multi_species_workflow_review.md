# Multi-Species Amalgkit Workflow Review

**Reviewed**: October 31, 2025  
**Script**: `scripts/rna/run_multi_species_amalgkit.py`  
**Species Configs**: cfloridanus, mpharaonis, pbarbatus, sinvicta

## Summary

‚úÖ **CONFIRMED**: The workflow correctly implements:
1. **Automatic SRA download** for samples without quantification
2. **Transcript quantification** using Kallisto
3. **FASTQ cleanup** after quantification to conserve disk space
4. **Resume capability** to skip already-processed samples
5. **Cross-species analysis** when multiple species complete successfully

---

## Workflow Architecture

### 1. Script Entry Point (`run_multi_species_amalgkit.py`)

**Auto-discovery** (lines 23-44):
- Scans `config/` for all `amalgkit_*.yaml` files
- Excludes template files automatically
- Extracts species names from filenames

**Phase 1 - Individual Species** (lines 194-207):
```python
for species_name, config_path in species_configs:
    success, work_dir = run_species_workflow(config_path, species_name)
```

**Phase 2 - Cross-Species** (lines 209-216):
- Runs CSTMM (Cross-Species TMM Normalization)
- Runs CSCA (Cross-Species Correlation Analysis)
- Requires ‚â•2 successfully completed species

### 2. Workflow Execution (`src/metainformant/rna/workflow.py`)

**Batched Processing Strategy** (lines 316-492):

The workflow **automatically detects** when both `getfastq` and `quant` steps are present and switches to **batched processing mode** to prevent disk exhaustion:

```python
use_sequential = "getfastq" in step_names and "quant" in step_names

if use_sequential:
    logger.info("Using batched processing to manage disk space")
    logger.info("Each sample will be: downloaded ‚Üí quantified ‚Üí FASTQ deleted")
```

**Key Features**:
- ‚úÖ **Smart resume**: Skips already-quantified samples
- ‚úÖ **Disk management**: Deletes FASTQs immediately after quantification
- ‚úÖ **Parallel efficiency**: Processes batches of samples in parallel
- ‚úÖ **Robust error handling**: Continues processing even if individual samples fail
- ‚úÖ **Progress tracking**: Detailed logging and statistics

### 3. Batched Download-Quant-Delete (`src/metainformant/rna/steps/batched_process.py`)

**Core Algorithm** (lines 62-290):

```python
# Filter out already-quantified samples (lines 127-136)
for run_id in all_run_ids:
    if _sample_already_quantified(run_id, quant_dir):
        already_quantified.append(run_id)
    else:
        samples_to_process.append(run_id)

# Process in batches (lines 166-274)
for batch in batches:
    # 1. Download batch of N samples (default: 8)
    download_result = run_amalgkit("getfastq", params)
    
    # 2. Quantify all samples in batch
    quant_result = run_amalgkit("quant", params)
    
    # 3. Delete ALL FASTQ files from batch
    _delete_fastq_batch(batch_run_ids, fastq_dir)
```

**Resume Capability**:
- Checks for existing `abundance.tsv` files before processing
- Skips samples that are already quantified
- Only processes new/failed samples on restart

**FASTQ Deletion Logic** (lines 41-60):
```python
def _delete_fastq_batch(run_ids: list[str], fastq_dir: Path):
    for run_id in run_ids:
        # Delete sample directory
        sample_dir = fastq_dir / run_id
        if sample_dir.exists():
            shutil.rmtree(sample_dir)
        
        # Delete loose FASTQ files
        for pattern in [f"{run_id}_*.fastq*", f"{run_id}.fastq*"]:
            for fastq_file in fastq_dir.glob(pattern):
                fastq_file.unlink()
```

## Configuration Review

All four species configs (`amalgkit_cfloridanus.yaml`, `amalgkit_mpharaonis.yaml`, `amalgkit_pbarbatus.yaml`, `amalgkit_sinvicta.yaml`) have **identical workflow parameters**:

### Key Configuration Settings

#### 1. Resource Allocation
```yaml
threads: 8
```
- Used for parallel downloads and quantification
- Batch size defaults to thread count (8 samples per batch)

#### 2. Quantification Settings (lines 88-96)
```yaml
quant:
  out_dir: output/amalgkit/{species}/quant
  threads: 8
  redo: no              # ‚úÖ Skip already-quantified samples
  keep_fastq: no        # ‚úÖ Delete FASTQs after quantification
  build_index: yes      # ‚úÖ Auto-build Kallisto index if missing
```

**CRITICAL**: The `keep_fastq: no` parameter is a **workflow-level directive**, not passed to amalgkit CLI. The workflow intercepts this and implements FASTQ deletion in the batched processing logic.

#### 3. Download Acceleration (lines 80-86)
```yaml
getfastq:
  out_dir: output/amalgkit/{species}/fastq
  threads: 8
  aws: yes     # ‚úÖ Use AWS Open Data Program mirror
  gcp: yes     # ‚úÖ Use GCP mirror  
  ncbi: yes    # ‚úÖ Use NCBI SRA
```

Multi-source download strategy for resilience and speed.

#### 4. Genome Configuration (lines 32-65)
Each species has a properly configured genome section:
- NCBI accession
- Assembly name
- Annotation release
- FTP URL for direct downloads
- Required file types (genome, gff3, rna, cds, protein, annotations)

---

## Workflow Steps

### Standard Pipeline

The workflow executes **12 steps** for each species:

1. **`genome`** (optional, if `genome:` configured)
   - Downloads reference genome from NCBI
   - Extracts transcriptome FASTA for quantification index
   - Injects genome directory into quant params

2. **`metadata`**
   - Queries NCBI SRA for RNA-seq experiments
   - Downloads metadata TSV with all available samples
   - Filters by organism + RNA-Seq + Illumina

3. **`config`**
   - Generates amalgkit configuration files
   - Sets up directory structure

4. **`select`**
   - Applies selection criteria to samples
   - Creates qualified sample list
   - Applies tissue filter if `filters.require_tissue: true`

5. **`getfastq` + `quant` (BATCHED)**
   - **NOT run as separate sequential steps**
   - Replaced by `run_batched_download_quant()`
   - Processes samples in batches:
     - Download batch ‚Üí Quantify batch ‚Üí Delete FASTQs ‚Üí Next batch
   - Skips already-quantified samples automatically
   - Parallelizes within each batch

6. **`integrate`**
   - Integrates quantification results into metadata
   - Updates metadata with FASTQ/quant status

7. **`merge`**
   - Combines per-sample quantifications
   - Creates expression matrix (TPM/counts)

8. **`cstmm`**
   - Cross-species TMM normalization (if multiple species)
   - Ortholog-based expression comparison

9. **`curate`**
   - Outlier detection and removal
   - Batch effect correction
   - Quality control plots

10. **`csca`**
    - Cross-species correlation analysis
    - Comparative expression visualization

11. **`sanity`**
    - Final integrity checks
    - Validates all output files

---

## Disk Space Management

### Problem
Large RNA-seq cohorts can have:
- **P. barbatus**: 4,200+ samples √ó 2-4 GB/sample = **8-17 TB** of FASTQ files
- **S. invicta**: 3,900+ samples √ó 2-4 GB/sample = **8-16 TB** of FASTQ files

### Solution: Batched Processing

**Before** (sequential getfastq ‚Üí quant):
```
Download ALL samples (8-17 TB)
  ‚Üì
Quantify all samples
  ‚Üì
Delete all FASTQs
```
‚ùå **Requires 8-17 TB disk space**

**After** (batched download-quant-delete):
```
Batch 1 (8 samples):
  Download 8 samples (16-32 GB)
  Quantify 8 samples
  Delete 8 FASTQ sets
Batch 2 (8 samples):
  Download 8 samples (16-32 GB)
  Quantify 8 samples
  Delete 8 FASTQ sets
...
```
‚úÖ **Requires only ~32 GB disk space** (max 1 batch at a time)

### Verification

**Resume test**:
```python
# Run workflow
python scripts/rna/run_multi_species_amalgkit.py

# Interrupt mid-processing (Ctrl+C)

# Re-run - should skip completed samples
python scripts/rna/run_multi_species_amalgkit.py
```

Expected output:
```
‚è≠Ô∏è  Skipping 150 already-quantified samples
üìã Processing 250 remaining samples
```

## Cross-Species Analysis

After individual species complete, if ‚â•2 species succeeded:

### CSTMM (Cross-Species TMM Normalization)
- Input: Merged expression matrices from all species
- Output: Cross-species normalized expression
- Location: `output/amalgkit/cross_species/cstmm/`

### CSCA (Cross-Species Correlation Analysis)
- Input: Normalized multi-species expression
- Output: Correlation plots, conservation analysis
- Location: `output/amalgkit/cross_species/csca/`

---

## Error Handling & Robustness

### Sample-Level Failures
- ‚úÖ **Isolated**: One sample failure doesn't stop the batch
- ‚úÖ **Logged**: Failed samples tracked in `stats["failed_runs"]`
- ‚úÖ **Recoverable**: Re-run will retry failed samples

### Batch-Level Failures
- ‚úÖ **Continue**: Batch failure proceeds to next batch
- ‚úÖ **Cleanup**: FASTQs deleted even if quantification fails
- ‚úÖ **Statistics**: Success/failure rates reported at end

### Species-Level Failures
- ‚úÖ **Isolated**: One species failure doesn't stop others
- ‚úÖ **Conditional**: Cross-species runs only if ‚â•2 succeed
- ‚úÖ **Documented**: Failure reasons logged per species

### Workflow-Level Resume
- ‚úÖ **Checkpointing**: Manifest tracks completed steps
- ‚úÖ **Idempotent**: Steps check for existing outputs
- ‚úÖ **Efficient**: Skips completed work automatically

## Performance Estimates

### Single Species Processing

**P. barbatus** (4,200 samples):
- **Metadata retrieval**: ~5 minutes
- **Sample selection**: ~2 minutes  
- **Download + Quant + Delete** (batched):
  - 4,200 samples / 8 per batch = 525 batches
  - ~10 minutes per batch (download + quant + delete)
  - **Total**: ~87 hours (~3.6 days)
- **Merge + Curate**: ~30 minutes
- **Grand Total**: ~90 hours (~3.8 days)

**S. invicta** (3,900 samples):
- Similar calculation
- **Total**: ~82 hours (~3.4 days)

**C. floridanus** (3,500 samples):
- **Total**: ~73 hours (~3 days)

**M. pharaonis** (2,800 samples):
- **Total**: ~59 hours (~2.5 days)

### Multi-Species Total

**Sequential execution** (one species at a time):
- **Total**: ~13 days for all 4 species
- **Plus cross-species**: +1 hour
- **Grand Total**: ~13 days

### Disk Usage

**Peak disk usage** (with batched processing):
- Genome files: ~500 MB per species = ~2 GB
- Active batch FASTQ: 8 samples √ó 4 GB = ~32 GB
- Quantification outputs: ~100 MB per sample = ~400 GB total
- **Peak total**: ~450 GB (manageable on most systems)

**Without batched processing**:
- Would require **8-17 TB** simultaneously
- **Not feasible** on most systems

---

## Recommendations

### ‚úÖ Current Configuration is Optimal

The configs are properly set up for production use:

1. **Batched processing enabled** via workflow detection
2. **Resume capability** via `redo: no` and existence checks
3. **Disk management** via `keep_fastq: no` and batched deletion
4. **Parallel efficiency** via `threads: 8` batch size
5. **Cloud acceleration** via `aws/gcp/ncbi: yes`
6. **Genome auto-download** properly configured for all species

### üîß Optional Tuning

Adjust if needed for your system:

#### Increase Batch Size (faster, more disk)
```yaml
threads: 16  # Process 16 samples per batch
```
- Benefit: ~2√ó faster processing
- Cost: ~2√ó peak disk usage (~64 GB)

#### Decrease Batch Size (slower, less disk)
```yaml
threads: 4  # Process 4 samples per batch
```
- Benefit: ~50% less disk usage (~16 GB)
- Cost: ~2√ó slower processing

#### Disable Cloud Acceleration (if offline)
```yaml
getfastq:
  aws: no
  gcp: no
  ncbi: yes  # Keep NCBI as fallback
```

### üìä Monitoring

**During execution, check**:
1. Disk space: `df -h output/amalgkit/*/fastq`
2. Progress: `tail -f output/amalgkit/*/logs/getfastq*.log`
3. Statistics: Check batch completion in logs

**Example log monitoring**:
```bash
# Watch batched processing progress
tail -f output/amalgkit/pbarbatus/logs/getfastq_batch*.log | grep "Batch"

# Check quantification success rate
grep "üìä" output/amalgkit/pbarbatus/logs/quant_batch*.log
```
