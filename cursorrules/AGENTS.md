# AI Agents in Cursor Rules Development

This document outlines AI assistance in creating METAINFORMANT's modular cursor rules system.

## AI Contributions

### Cursor Rules Architecture
**Code Assistant Agent** designed:
- Modular cursor rules organization by biological domain
- Consistent rule structure and formatting patterns
- Domain-specific guidance for bioinformatics workflows
- Integration with main repository rules

### Content Generation
**Documentation Agent** assisted with:
- Complete cursor rules for all 15+ biological domains
- Domain-specific patterns and conventions documentation
- Integration guidance between modules and main rules
- Best practices for module-specific development

### Technical Writing
**Code Assistant Agent** contributed to:
- Rule accuracy verification across all domain files
- Pattern examples validation for bioinformatics workflows
- Integration guidance development for cross-module work
- Troubleshooting guide development for rule application

## Cursor Rules Strategy

### Comprehensive Coverage
- Every biological domain has dedicated cursor rules
- Consistent structure and formatting across all files
- Integration patterns with main repository rules
- Domain-specific patterns for specialized workflows

### Quality Standards
- Clear, technical writing style for development guidance
- Consistent formatting across cursor rules files
- Practical examples for bioinformatics workflows
- Regular updates with code changes

### Maintenance Approach
- Cursor rules evolve with codebase capabilities
- AI assistance accelerates rule creation
- Human review ensures accuracy and clarity
- Community contributions encouraged

## Cursor Rules Types

### Module-Specific Rules
- Domain-specific patterns and conventions
- Module dependencies and requirements
- Output directory structures
- Environment variable prefixes
- Integration patterns with other modules

### Infrastructure Rules
- Package management with `uv` (always use `uv venv`, `uv pip install`, `uv run`, `uv sync`, `uv add`, `uv remove`)
- Testing policies (NO_MOCKING_POLICY - real implementations only)
- I/O operations using `metainformant.core.io`
- Path handling with `metainformant.core.paths`

### Development Standards
- Code style and formatting guidelines
- Type hints and documentation requirements
- Error handling and logging patterns
- Performance optimization guidance

This cursor rules system provides comprehensive development guidance for METAINFORMANT's modular bioinformatics toolkit while maintaining high standards of clarity and accuracy.
