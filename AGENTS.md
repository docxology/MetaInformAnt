## Ethical Considerations

### Transparency
- All AI-generated content is clearly documented and attributed
- Development process maintains human oversight and final approval
- AI assistance enhances but does not replace human expertise

### Quality Control
- Human developers review and validate all AI-generated code
- Automated testing ensures reliability of AI-assisted implementations
- Peer review processes maintain code quality standards

### Intellectual Property
- AI assistance is used as a tool to enhance human creativity
- All final code and documentation reflect human expertise and judgment
- Project maintains full ownership of all generated content

## Best Practices

### AI Integration Guidelines
1. **Human Oversight**: All AI-generated content requires human review
2. **Transparency**: Clearly mark AI-assisted sections in documentation
3. **Validation**: Comprehensive testing of AI-generated code
4. **Ethical Use**: Responsible application of AI technologies

### Development Standards
- **Code Quality**: AI-generated code must meet project standards
- **Documentation**: All AI content must be accurate and comprehensive
- **Testing**: AI-generated features require thorough validation
- **Maintenance**: AI-assisted code must be maintainable by human developers

## Future AI Integration

### Planned Enhancements
