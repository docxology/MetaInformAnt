# AI Agents in RNA Archive Scripts Development

This document outlines AI assistance in developing archived RNA-seq analysis scripts and legacy workflow management utilities.

## AI Contributions

### RNA Workflow Archival
**Code Assistant Agent** (grok-code-fast-1) organized:
- Historical RNA-seq pipeline implementations and configurations
- Deprecated amalgkit integration scripts and wrappers
- Legacy species-specific workflow parameters and settings
- Outdated quality control and preprocessing utilities

### Legacy System Documentation
**Documentation Agent** (GPT-4) contributed to:
- Comprehensive documentation of deprecated RNA analysis approaches
- Migration guides for updating from older RNA-seq workflows
- Compatibility matrices showing which old scripts work with new data
- Historical context for changes in RNA analysis methodologies

### Archive Management
**Code Assistant Agent** implemented:
- Systematic categorization of RNA-related archived scripts
- Version compatibility tracking and documentation
- Data format migration utilities for RNA-seq datasets
- Preservation of historical RNA analysis workflows

## Archived RNA Components

### Pipeline Scripts
- **Legacy Amalgkit Wrappers**: Earlier versions of automated RNA-seq workflows
- **Deprecated Quality Control**: Outdated read filtering and assessment tools
- **Historical Quantification**: Previous methods for transcript abundance estimation
- **Outdated Assembly**: Legacy transcriptome assembly and annotation approaches

### Configuration Archives
- **Species-Specific Settings**: Deprecated workflow parameters for different organisms
- **Tool Version Dependencies**: Documentation of software version requirements
- **Resource Specifications**: Historical compute resource allocations

- **Performance Baseline**: Historical performance metrics documented

## Quality Assurance

### Validation Procedures
- **Execution Testing**: Archived RNA scripts run on appropriate test data
- **Result Verification**: Output formats and biological correctness confirmed
- **Data Compatibility**: Legacy RNA-seq formats still parseable
- **Documentation Accuracy**: Migration guides and usage instructions correct

### Migration Support
- **Transition Tools**: Scripts for converting old RNA workflows to new systems
- **Data Translation**: Utilities for updating RNA-seq data formats
- **Parameter Mapping**: Correspondence between old and new parameter settings
- **Validation Checks**: Automated verification of migration success

## Integration Considerations
