# AI Agents in Multi-Omics Integration Script Development

This document outlines AI assistance in developing METAINFORMANT's multi-omics integration workflow scripts.

## AI Contributions

### Script Architecture
**Code Assistant Agent** designed:
- Unified multi-omics integration workflow orchestrator
- Modular analysis components (correlation, joint PCA, CCA)
- Cross-omics data integration
- Quality assessment and visualization

### Automation Features
**Code Assistant Agent** implemented:
- `run_multiomics_integration.py`: Multi-omics integration orchestrator
- `example_basic_integration.py`: Basic integration examples
- `example_cca.py`: Canonical correlation analysis examples
- `example_joint_analysis.py`: Joint analysis examples

### User Experience
**Documentation Agent** contributed to:
- Multi-omics integration usage examples
- Method parameter descriptions
- Integration quality assessment documentation
- Cross-omics analysis guides

## Script Categories

### Multi-Omics Integration (`run_multiomics_integration.py`)
**Code Assistant Agent** created:
- Multi-omics data loading and preprocessing
- Joint dimensionality reduction (PCA, NMF)
- Canonical correlation analysis
- Cross-omics correlation analysis
- Integration quality assessment

### Example Scripts
**Code Assistant Agent** developed:
- Basic integration workflow examples
- CCA methodology demonstrations
- Joint analysis tutorials
- Best practices guides

## Design Principles

1. **Multi-Omics Support**: Genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics integration
2. **Advanced Integration**: Joint PCA, CCA, correlation methods
3. **Quality Assessment**: Integration validation and diagnostics
4. **Scalability**: Efficient large dataset processing
5. **Modular Design**: Individual analysis components

## Integration

Scripts integrate with:
- **metainformant.multiomics**: Core multi-omics functionality
- **scikit-learn**: Dimensionality reduction and CCA
- **Core utilities**: I/O, logging, path management

## Maintenance Practices

- Regular updates with new integration methods
- Testing with diverse multi-omics datasets
- Documentation updates with new techniques
- Performance optimization for large-scale integration

This multi-omics suite provides comprehensive cross-omics integration capabilities for METAINFORMANT workflows.
