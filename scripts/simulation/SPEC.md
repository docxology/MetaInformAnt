# SPEC: Simulation Scripts

Orchestration of biological data simulations across sequences and ecosystems.

## Workflows

- `simulate_genome_evolution.py`: Generates synthetic lineages with customizable mutation rates.
- `run_ecosystem_simulation.py`: Agent-based modeling of species interactions.

## Standards

- **Seeds**: Required use of fixed random seeds for reproducibility of synthetic datasets.
- **Scalability**: Capable of generating millions of synthetic sequences using `ParallelProcessor`.
