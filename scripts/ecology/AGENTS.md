# AI Agents in Ecology Analysis Script Development

This document outlines AI assistance in developing METAINFORMANT's ecological analysis workflow scripts.

## AI Contributions

### Script Architecture
**Code Assistant Agent** designed:
- Unified ecological analysis workflow orchestrator
- Modular analysis components (diversity, beta diversity, rarefaction)
- Statistical analysis integration
- Comprehensive output generation

### Automation Features
**Code Assistant Agent** implemented:
- `run_ecology_analysis.py`: Comprehensive ecological community analysis
- Alpha diversity calculations (Shannon, Simpson, richness)
- Beta diversity analysis (Bray-Curtis, Jaccard, UniFrac)
- Rarefaction curve generation
- Community composition analysis

### User Experience
**Documentation Agent** contributed to:
- Ecological analysis usage examples
- Parameter descriptions and validation
- Output structure documentation
- Integration with metainformant.ecology module

## Script Categories

### Ecology Analysis Orchestrator (`run_ecology_analysis.py`)
**Code Assistant Agent** created:
- Community ecology metrics calculation
- Diversity analysis with statistical testing
- Ordination and clustering analysis
- Rarefaction analysis for sampling completeness
- Comprehensive visualization generation

## Design Principles

1. **Ecological Standards**: Implementation of standard ecological metrics
2. **Statistical Rigor**: Proper statistical testing and validation
3. **Visualization**: Comprehensive plotting for ecological data
4. **Integration**: Seamless connection with metainformant.ecology module
5. **Scalability**: Efficient processing of ecological datasets

## Integration

Scripts integrate with:
- **metainformant.ecology**: Core ecological analysis functionality
- **scikit-bio/scipy**: Diversity and distance calculations
- **Core utilities**: I/O, logging, path management
- **Visualization**: Plot generation for ecological data

## Maintenance Practices

- Regular updates with new ecological methods
- Testing with diverse ecological datasets
- Documentation updates with new analysis features
- Performance optimization for large community datasets

This ecology analysis suite provides comprehensive community ecology analysis capabilities for METAINFORMANT workflows.
