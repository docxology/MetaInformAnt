# AI Agents in Protein Analysis Script Development

This document outlines AI assistance in developing METAINFORMANT's protein sequence and structure analysis workflow scripts.

## AI Contributions

### Script Architecture
**Code Assistant Agent** designed:
- Unified protein analysis workflow orchestrator
- Modular analysis components (sequence, structure, domains)
- Comprehensive protein characterization
- Integration with structural bioinformatics

### Automation Features
**Code Assistant Agent** implemented:
- `run_protein_analysis.py`: Protein analysis workflow orchestrator
- Sequence analysis and validation
- Structure prediction and modeling
- Domain and motif identification
- Functional annotation

### User Experience
**Documentation Agent** contributed to:
- Protein analysis usage examples
- Sequence and structure analysis guides
- Domain identification documentation
- Integration with metainformant.protein module

## Script Categories

### Protein Analysis Orchestrator (`run_protein_analysis.py`)
**Code Assistant Agent** created:
- Protein sequence preprocessing and validation
- Physicochemical property calculation
- Structure prediction workflows
- Domain and motif identification
- Functional annotation analysis

## Design Principles

1. **Sequence Analysis**: Comprehensive sequence characterization
2. **Structure Prediction**: Integration with prediction tools
3. **Domain Identification**: Functional domain analysis
4. **Quality Control**: Sequence and structure validation
5. **Biological Context**: Functional interpretation

## Integration

Scripts integrate with:
- **metainformant.protein**: Core protein analysis functionality
- **Biopython**: Sequence and structure handling
- **Core utilities**: I/O, logging, path management

## Maintenance Practices

- Regular updates with new analysis methods
- Testing with diverse protein families
- Documentation updates with new techniques
- Performance optimization for large proteomes

This protein analysis suite provides comprehensive protein characterization capabilities for METAINFORMANT workflows.
