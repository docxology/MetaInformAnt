# SPEC: Protein Scripts

Scripts for protein sequence analysis, structure prediction, and database integration.

## Workflows

- `analyze_protein_structure.py`: Processes PDB files to calculate structural metrics.
- `fetch_uniprot_data.py`: Automated retrieval and annotation of protein sequences.

## Standards

- **Structure Formats**: Supports PDB and mmCIF formats.
- **Accuracy**: All functional annotations are cross-referenced with UniProt/AlphaFold records.
