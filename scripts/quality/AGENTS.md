- Unified quality control workflow orchestrator
- Modular QC components (FASTQ, contamination, validation)
- Comprehensive quality assessment
- Automated quality reporting

### Automation Features
**Code Assistant Agent** implemented:
- `run_quality_control.py`: Quality control workflow orchestrator
- FASTQ quality assessment and metrics
- Sequence contamination detection
- Data integrity validation
- Quality reporting and visualization

### User Experience
**Documentation Agent** contributed to:
- Quality control usage examples
- QC metric interpretation guides
- Quality standard documentation
- Integration with metainformant.quality module

## Script Categories

### Quality Control Orchestrator (`run_quality_control.py`)
**Code Assistant Agent** created:
- FASTQ quality score analysis
- Base composition and distribution analysis
- Contamination screening
- Quality metric calculation
- Comprehensive quality reporting

## Design Principles

1. **Comprehensive Assessment**: Multiple quality dimensions
2. **Standard Metrics**: Industry-standard QC measures
3. **Automated Reporting**: Clear quality summaries
4. **Integration**: Seamless workflow integration
5. **Actionable Results**: Clear quality improvement guidance

## Integration

Scripts integrate with:
- **metainformant.quality**: Core quality control functionality
- **Biopython**: Sequence quality analysis
