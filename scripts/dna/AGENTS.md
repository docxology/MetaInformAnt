# AI Agents in DNA Analysis Script Development

This document outlines AI assistance in developing METAINFORMANT's DNA analysis workflow scripts.

## AI Contributions

### Script Architecture
**Code Assistant Agent** designed:
- Unified DNA analysis workflow orchestrator
- Modular analysis components (sequence, composition, population)
- Consistent command-line interface with core utilities
- Error handling and logging integration

### Automation Features
**Code Assistant Agent** implemented:
- `run_dna_analysis.py`: Comprehensive DNA sequence analysis workflow
- Sequence quality control and filtering
- Composition analysis (GC content, nucleotide frequencies)
- Population genetics integration
- Phylogenetic analysis support

### User Experience
**Documentation Agent** contributed to:
- Comprehensive usage examples
- Parameter descriptions and validation
- Output structure documentation
- Integration with metainformant.dna module

## Script Categories

### DNA Analysis Orchestrator (`run_dna_analysis.py`)
**Code Assistant Agent** created:
- Sequence processing and quality assessment
- Composition analysis with statistical reporting
- Population genetics metrics calculation
- Phylogenetic tree construction support
- Comprehensive output generation

## Design Principles

1. **Modular Analysis**: Separate components for different analysis types
2. **Quality Control**: Sequence filtering and validation
3. **Statistical Reporting**: Comprehensive metrics and visualizations
4. **Integration**: Seamless connection with metainformant.dna module
5. **Scalability**: Efficient processing of large sequence datasets

## Integration

Scripts integrate with:
- **metainformant.dna**: Core DNA analysis functionality
- **Biopython**: Sequence parsing and manipulation
- **Core utilities**: I/O, logging, path management
- **Visualization**: Plot generation for sequence analysis

## Maintenance Practices

- Regular updates with new analysis methods
- Testing with diverse sequence datasets
- Documentation updates with new features
- Performance optimization for large datasets

This DNA analysis suite provides comprehensive sequence analysis capabilities for METAINFORMANT workflows.
