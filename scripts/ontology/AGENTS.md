# AI Agents in Ontology Analysis Script Development

This document outlines AI assistance in developing METAINFORMANT's functional ontology analysis workflow scripts.

## AI Contributions

### Script Architecture
**Code Assistant Agent** designed:
- Unified ontology analysis workflow orchestrator
- Modular analysis components (queries, enrichment, similarity)
- OBO file processing and validation
- Semantic analysis capabilities

### Automation Features
**Code Assistant Agent** implemented:
- `run_ontology_analysis.py`: Ontology analysis workflow orchestrator
- Ontology loading and parsing (OBO format)
- Term querying and navigation
- Semantic similarity calculations
- Ontology enrichment analysis

### User Experience
**Documentation Agent** contributed to:
- Ontology analysis usage examples
- GO term navigation guides
- Enrichment analysis documentation
- Integration with metainformant.ontology module

## Script Categories

### Ontology Analysis Orchestrator (`run_ontology_analysis.py`)
**Code Assistant Agent** created:
- Ontology file loading and validation
- Term hierarchy navigation
- Semantic similarity computation
- Enrichment analysis for gene sets
- Ontology visualization and reporting

## Design Principles

1. **Ontology Standards**: Support for OBO format and GO
2. **Semantic Analysis**: Advanced similarity calculations
3. **Biological Context**: Gene set enrichment interpretation
4. **Performance**: Efficient large ontology processing
5. **Standards Compliance**: Adherence to ontology best practices

## Integration

Scripts integrate with:
- **metainformant.ontology**: Core ontology analysis functionality
- **pronto**: Ontology parsing
- **Core utilities**: I/O, logging, path management

## Maintenance Practices

- Regular updates with ontology format changes
- Testing with current GO releases
- Documentation updates with new methods
- Performance optimization for large ontologies

This ontology analysis suite provides comprehensive functional annotation capabilities for METAINFORMANT workflows.
