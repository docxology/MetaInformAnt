## Development Guidelines

### Code Organization
- **Modular Design**: Each domain is self-contained with clear interfaces
- **Consistent Patterns**: Similar structure and API patterns across modules
- **Defensive Imports**: Optional dependencies handled gracefully
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive type hints throughout

### API Design Principles
- **Functional APIs**: Accept destination paths rather than writing to fixed locations
- **Composable Operations**: Functions designed to work together
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages with biological context
- **Performance Awareness**: Efficient algorithms for large biological datasets

### Integration Patterns
```python
# Cross-module integration example
from metainformant.dna import sequences, phylogeny
from metainformant.visualization import trees

# Load and analyze DNA sequences
seqs = sequences.read_fasta("data/sequences.fasta")
tree = phylogeny.neighbor_joining_tree(seqs)
trees.visualize_tree(tree, "output/tree.png")
```

## Documentation

Each module includes:
- **Comprehensive README.md** with usage examples
- **API documentation** for all public functions
- **Integration examples** showing cross-module usage
- **Performance notes** and best practices

## Testing

The source code includes extensive tests:
- Unit tests for individual functions
- Integration tests for cross-module functionality
- Performance benchmarks for scalability
- Real data validation tests

## Contributing

### Adding New Modules
1. Create new subdirectory in `src/metainformant/`
2. Follow established patterns for `__init__.py` and module structure
3. Add comprehensive tests in `tests/` directory
4. Update main package `__init__.py` exports
5. Create detailed README.md documentation

### Code Standards
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Include docstrings for all public APIs
- Maintain backward compatibility when possible
- Add type hints for better IDE support

This source code organization provides a solid foundation for comprehensive biological data analysis while maintaining modularity and extensibility.
