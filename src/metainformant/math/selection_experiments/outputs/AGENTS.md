# AI Agents in Selection Experiment Output Documentation

This document notes AI involvement in documenting the output artefacts of the selection experiment suite.

## AI Contributions

### Output Cataloging
**Documentation Agent** summarized:
- Generated plot set (`plot-*.png`) and the composite graphical abstract
- Expected directory layout and naming conventions under `output/math/selection_experiments`
- Cleanup and regeneration practices aligned with repository policies

### Verification Support
**Code Assistant Agent** validated:
- CLI commands used to produce the documented artefacts
- Consistency between plotting code and the descriptions in `README.md`
- Compliance with `metainformant.core.paths` safeguards for destination handling

## Maintenance Tips
- Refresh screenshots and filenames after adding new experiment scenarios
- Keep documentation synchronized with CLI option changes or output format updates
- Mark AI-assisted documentation edits for human review prior to release
