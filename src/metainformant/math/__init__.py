"""Mathematical and theoretical biology utilities.

This subpackage provides quantitative biology primitives used across domains:
- Price equation and selection decomposition
- Kin and multilevel selection toy calculators
- Driftâ€“Diffusion models (DDM)

These are deliberately lightweight, dependency-minimal, and intended for
composition with `core` utilities and `dna`/`rna`/`protein` domain modules.
