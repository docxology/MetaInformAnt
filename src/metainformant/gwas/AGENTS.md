# AI Agents in GWAS Module Development

This document outlines AI assistance in creating and maintaining the METAINFORMANT GWAS (Genome-Wide Association Studies) module.

## AI Contributions

### Module Design and Implementation
**Code Assistant Agent** designed:
- Complete GWAS workflow architecture with modular components
- Quality control filter implementations (MAF, missingness, HWE)
- Population structure analysis (PCA, kinship matrices)
- Association testing algorithms (linear/logistic regression)
- Multiple testing correction methods (Bonferroni, FDR, genomic control)
- Visualization functions (Manhattan plots, Q-Q plots)

### Code Implementation
**Code Assistant Agent** implemented:
- `quality.py` - Quality control filters and variant filtering
- `structure.py` - Population structure analysis and PCA computation
- `association.py` - Association testing with covariate adjustment
- `correction.py` - Multiple testing correction algorithms
- `visualization.py` - Result visualization and plotting
- `calling.py` - Variant calling integration with bcftools/GATK
- `download.py` - Data acquisition from public databases
- `config.py` - Configuration management and validation
- `workflow.py` - Workflow orchestration and execution

### Testing and Validation
**Code Assistant Agent** contributed to:
- Real implementation testing (NO_MOCKING_POLICY compliance)
- Integration tests with DNA and math modules
- Scientific validation against established methods
- Performance testing on realistic datasets

## Scientific Accuracy

### Algorithm Validation
All GWAS algorithms follow established methods:
- PCA for population stratification (Price et al. 2006)
- Kinship matrix computation (VanRaden 2008, Astle-Balding)
- Linear/logistic regression for association testing
- Bonferroni and Benjamini-Hochberg correction methods

### Integration with Literature
- Implementation based on peer-reviewed publications
- Validation against tools like PLINK and GCTA
- Performance benchmarking on standard datasets

## Best Practices

### Code Quality
- Type hints throughout for static analysis
- Comprehensive docstrings following numpy style
- Modular functions with single responsibilities
- Consistent error handling and logging

### Performance Optimization
- Efficient NumPy operations for matrix computations
- Parallel processing support for large-scale analysis
- Memory-efficient VCF parsing
- Optional sparse matrix operations

This module demonstrates responsible AI assistance in bioinformatics software development, combining automated implementation with scientific rigor and human validation.
