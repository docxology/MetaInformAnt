# DNA Sequence Analysis

Core tools for analyzing DNA sequences.

## Components
- `core.py`: Fundamental string operations for DNA.
- `composition.py`: Calculate GC content, skewed distribution.
- `motifs.py`: Find and analyze sequence motifs.
- `restriction.py`: Simulate restriction enzyme digestion.
- `consensus.py`: Generate consensus sequences.
