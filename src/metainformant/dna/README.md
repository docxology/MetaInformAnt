from metainformant.dna import population, variants

# Integrated population analysis
diversity = population.nucleotide_diversity(sequences)

- Performance benchmarking
- Integration testing with other modules
- Edge case handling

## Dependencies

- **Core**: Biopython (for sequence objects and algorithms)
- **Optional**: NCBI Datasets tools, Entrez API access
- **Performance**: NumPy for efficient array operations

## Usage Examples

### Basic Sequence Analysis

    gc = composition.gc_content(seq)
    print(f"{name}: GC content = {gc:.2%}")
