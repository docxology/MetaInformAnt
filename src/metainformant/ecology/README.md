# Ecology Module

The `ecology` module provides tools for ecological metadata management, community analysis, and environmental data integration.

## Overview

This module handles ecological data including species diversity, community composition, and environmental parameters that influence biological systems.

## Submodules

### Community Analysis (`community.py`)
Tools for analyzing ecological communities and species interactions.

**Key Features:**
- Species diversity metrics (Shannon, Simpson indices)
- Community composition analysis
- Species abundance distributions
- Beta diversity calculations

**Usage:**
```python
from metainformant.ecology import community

# Community analysis
abundance_data = load_species_abundance()
diversity = community.shannon_diversity(abundance_data)
composition = community.analyze_composition(abundance_data)
```

## Integration with Other Modules

### With DNA Module
```python
from metainformant.dna import population
from metainformant.ecology import community

# Ecological context for genetic diversity
genetic_diversity = population.nucleotide_diversity(sequences)
ecological_diversity = community.calculate_diversity(species_data)
```

### With Visualization Module
```python
from metainformant.ecology import community
from metainformant.visualization import plots

# Visualize community structure
community_data = community.load_community_data("survey_data.csv")
plots.heatmap(community_data, title="Species Abundance")
```

## Data Sources

- Species occurrence databases
- Environmental monitoring data
- Biodiversity surveys and inventories
- Ecological metadata repositories

## Performance Features

- Efficient processing of large ecological datasets
- Memory-optimized community calculations
- Support for sparse ecological matrices

## Testing

Comprehensive tests cover:
- Diversity metric calculations
- Community analysis algorithms
- Integration with environmental data

## Dependencies

- NumPy for numerical computations
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Optional: specialized ecological packages

This module provides essential tools for ecological data analysis and biodiversity research.
