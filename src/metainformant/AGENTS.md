# AI Agents in METAINFORMANT Source Development

This document outlines the AI agents and language models that have contributed to the development of the METAINFORMANT bioinformatics toolkit source code.

## Output Directory Policy

**CRITICAL**: All code generated by AI agents must write program outputs to `output/` by default, but **never** create documentation, reports, test scripts, or planning documents in `output/`. These belong in `docs/`, `tests/`, or `scripts/` respectively. See `output/.cursorrules` for the complete policy.
