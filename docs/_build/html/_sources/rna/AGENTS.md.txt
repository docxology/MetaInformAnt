# AI Agents in RNA Documentation Development

This document outlines AI assistance in creating METAINFORMANT's comprehensive RNA analysis documentation.

## AI Contributions

### Documentation Architecture
**Documentation Agent** designed:
- Hierarchical RNA workflow documentation structure
- Step-by-step pipeline explanation frameworks
- Configuration template documentation patterns
- Integration guide organization for RNA workflows

### Content Generation
**Documentation Agent** assisted with:
- Complete RNA module documentation
- Workflow orchestration explanation
- Configuration management guides
- Integration patterns with other modules

### Technical Writing
**Code Assistant Agent** contributed to:
- API reference accuracy verification for RNA functions
- Code example validation for workflow functions
- Performance consideration documentation for RNA analysis
- Troubleshooting guide development for pipeline issues

## Documentation Strategy

### Comprehensive Coverage
- Every RNA workflow step documented
- Configuration options fully explained
- Integration patterns with DNA and protein modules
- Performance and testing guidance

### Quality Standards
- Clear, technical writing style for bioinformatics
- Consistent formatting across RNA docs
- Practical, runnable code examples
- Regular updates with code changes

### Maintenance Approach
- Documentation evolves with RNA capabilities
- AI assistance accelerates content creation
- Human review ensures accuracy and clarity
- Community contributions encouraged

This documentation system provides comprehensive guidance for RNA analysis workflows while maintaining high standards of clarity and accuracy.

## Output Directory Policy

**CRITICAL**: All documentation created by AI agents must be placed in `docs/rna/`, never in `output/`. The `output/` directory is strictly for program-generated execution outputs. See `output/.cursorrules` for the complete policy.

- Documentation files → `docs/rna/<subdirectory>/`
- Test reports → `docs/rna/` or delete after review
- Review documents → `docs/rna/` or delete after review
- Planning documents → `docs/rna/` or delete after review
- Test scripts → `tests/` or `scripts/`
