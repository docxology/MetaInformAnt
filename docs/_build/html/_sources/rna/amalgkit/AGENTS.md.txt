- AI assistance accelerates content creation
- Human review ensures accuracy and clarity
- Community contributions encouraged

This documentation system provides comprehensive guidance for RNA analysis workflows while maintaining high standards of clarity and accuracy.

## Output Directory Policy

**CRITICAL**: All documentation created by AI agents must be placed in `docs/rna/amalgkit/`, never in `output/`. The `output/` directory is strictly for program-generated execution outputs. See `output/.cursorrules` for the complete policy.

- Documentation files → `docs/rna/amalgkit/<subdirectory>/`
- Test reports → `docs/rna/` or delete after review
- Review documents → `docs/rna/` or delete after review
- Planning documents → `docs/rna/` or delete after review
- Test scripts → `tests/` or `scripts/`
