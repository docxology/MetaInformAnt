# AI Agents in GWAS Module Development

This document outlines AI assistance in creating and maintaining the METAINFORMANT GWAS (Genome-Wide Association Studies) module.

## AI Contributions

### Module Design and Architecture
**Code Assistant Agent** designed:
- Complete GWAS workflow pipeline from variant acquisition to visualization
- Modular architecture with separate components for QC, structure, association, correction, and visualization
- Integration with existing DNA and math modules
- Flexible configuration system supporting YAML/TOML/JSON

### Implementation
**Code Assistant Agent** implemented:
- Variant data acquisition (VCF parsing, database downloads, variant calling)
- Quality control filters (MAF, missingness, HWE, quality scores)
- Population structure analysis (PCA, kinship matrix computation)
- Association testing (linear and logistic regression with covariate adjustment)
- Multiple testing correction methods (Bonferroni, FDR, genomic control)
- Visualization functions (Manhattan plots, Q-Q plots, regional plots)

### Documentation
**Documentation Agent** created:
- Comprehensive module README with features and quick start
- Step-by-step workflow guide
- Detailed configuration reference
- Example configurations (including P. barbatus real-world example)
- Verification and validation report
- API documentation for all public functions

### Testing
**Code Assistant Agent** contributed:
- Real implementation testing (NO_MOCKING_POLICY compliance)
- Integration tests with DNA and math modules
- Configuration validation tests
- End-to-end workflow tests
- Performance and scalability tests

## Design Decisions

### Modular Architecture
The GWAS module is organized into focused submodules:
- `quality.py` - Quality control filters
- `structure.py` - Population structure analysis
- `association.py` - Association testing
- `correction.py` - Multiple testing correction
- `visualization.py` - Result visualization
- `calling.py` - Variant calling integration
- `download.py` - Data acquisition
- `config.py` - Configuration management
- `workflow.py` - Workflow orchestration

### Integration with Existing Modules
- Leverages `dna.variants` for VCF parsing
- Uses `dna.population` for population genetics statistics
- Integrates `math.popgen` for theoretical calculations
- Uses `ml.regression` for regression models
- Employs `visualization.plots` for plotting utilities

### Configuration-Driven Design
- YAML/TOML/JSON configuration support
- Environment variable overrides
- Flexible workflow customization
- Default parameters for common use cases

## Scientific Validation

### Algorithm Implementation
All GWAS algorithms follow established scientific methods:
- PCA uses standard eigendecomposition for population stratification
- Kinship matrices follow VanRaden (2008) and Astle-Balding methods
- Association testing implements standard linear/logistic regression
- Multiple testing correction uses Bonferroni and Benjamini-Hochberg FDR

### Validation Strategy
- Comparison with established GWAS tools (PLINK, GCTA)
- Synthetic data testing with known associations
- Real-world dataset validation (P. barbatus example)
- Performance benchmarking on large-scale datasets

## Best Practices

### Code Quality
- Type hints throughout for static analysis
- Comprehensive docstrings following numpy style
- Modular functions with single responsibilities
- Consistent error handling and logging

### Performance Optimization
- Efficient matrix operations using NumPy
- Parallel processing support for association testing
- Memory-efficient VCF parsing for large files
- Optional sparse matrix support for large-scale studies

### Testing Standards
- Real implementation testing (no mocks)
- Integration tests with related modules
- Edge case and error condition testing
- Performance regression testing

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Mixed linear model (MLM) association testing
- Gene-based and pathway-based tests
- Polygenic risk score (PRS) calculation
- Conditional analysis for fine-mapping
- Meta-analysis across multiple studies

### Performance Improvements
- GPU acceleration for large-scale analysis
- Distributed computing support for biobank-scale data
- Streaming VCF processing for memory efficiency
- Optimized kinship matrix computation

### Integration Enhancements
- Direct integration with public GWAS catalogs
- Automated functional annotation of significant variants
- Integration with gene expression data (eQTL analysis)
- Multi-trait GWAS analysis
