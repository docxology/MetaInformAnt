# Machine Learning Documentation

This directory contains documentation for METAINFORMANT's machine learning and statistical analysis capabilities.

## Overview

The machine learning module provides tools for classification, regression, feature selection, and model validation specifically designed for biological and omics data analysis.

## Documentation Files

### Machine Learning Analysis
- **`index.md`**: Machine learning domain overview and module index

## Related Source Code

- See `src/metainformant/ml/` for implementation details
- See `tests/test_ml_*.py` for comprehensive test coverage

## Usage Examples

Machine learning for biological data:

```python
from metainformant.ml import classification, feature_selection

# Classify gene expression data
model = classification.train_classifier(expression_data, labels)
predictions = classification.predict(model, test_data)

# Feature selection for high-dimensional omics data
selected_features = feature_selection.select_features(omics_data, target_variable)
```

## Integration

Machine learning integrates with all domain modules:
- **RNA/Single-cell**: Expression pattern classification
- **DNA**: Variant effect prediction
- **Protein**: Function prediction
- **Multi-omics**: Integrated analysis pipelines

## Algorithms
