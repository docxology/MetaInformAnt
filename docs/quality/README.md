# Quality Control Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for METAINFORMANT's data quality assessment and validation capabilities.

## Overview

The quality control domain provides tools for assessing and ensuring data quality across various biological data types, with particular focus on high-throughput sequencing data.

## Documentation Files

### Core Quality Control
- **`index.md`**: Quality control domain overview and module index
- **`fastq.md`**: FASTQ format quality analysis and assessment

## Related Source Code

- See `src/metainformant/quality/` for implementation details
- See `tests/test_quality_*.py` for comprehensive test coverage
- See `src/metainformant/quality/README.md` for module-specific documentation

## Usage Examples

The quality control domain supports comprehensive data assessment:

```python
from metainformant.quality.fastq import analyze_fastq_quality

# Comprehensive FASTQ quality analysis
results = analyze_fastq_quality("sample.fastq.gz")

# Quality metrics and recommendations
print(f"Mean quality: {results['basic_stats']['mean_quality']:.2f}")
print(f"GC content: {results['basic_stats']['gc_content']:.1f}%")

if results['adapter_content']['max_adapter_content'] > 20:
    print("Warning: High adapter content detected")
```

## Integration

Quality control integrates with:
- **DNA/RNA analysis** for sequence quality validation
- **Single-cell workflows** for data preprocessing
- **Visualization tools** for quality report generation
- **Statistical methods** for quality metric analysis

## Testing

Comprehensive tests ensure quality assessment reliability:
- Quality metric calculation validation
- File format compatibility testing
- Performance benchmarking with large datasets
- Integration testing with analysis workflows

## Contributing

When adding new quality control functionality:
1. Update quality assessment documentation
2. Add comprehensive algorithm tests
3. Ensure compatibility with multiple file formats
4. Update integration examples

This documentation provides complete coverage of METAINFORMANT's quality control capabilities.
