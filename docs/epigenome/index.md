### Epigenome: Overview

Epigenetic modification analysis including DNA methylation patterns and chromatin accessibility.

## Key Components

### DNA Methylation Analysis
- **Methylation calling**: Identify methylated cytosines from sequencing data
- **Differential methylation**: Compare methylation patterns between conditions
- **Promoter analysis**: Assess methylation status of regulatory regions
- **CpG island analysis**: Study methylation in CpG-rich regions

### Chromatin Accessibility
- **ATAC-seq analysis**: Open chromatin region identification
- **Peak calling**: Statistical detection of accessible regions
- **Motif analysis**: Transcription factor binding site discovery
- **Differential accessibility**: Compare chromatin states between samples

## Integration with Genomics

Epigenetic data integrates closely with genomic analysis:
- **Gene regulation**: Connect methylation/accessibility to gene expression
- **Chromatin structure**: Link to 3D genome organization
- **Functional annotation**: Associate epigenetic marks with biological function
- **Comparative epigenetics**: Study epigenetic evolution across species

## Analysis Workflows

### Methylation Analysis Pipeline
```python
from metainformant.epigenome import methylation

# Load methylation data (Bismark output)
methylation_data = methylation.load_bismark_output("methylation_calls.txt")

# Calculate methylation levels
methylation_levels = methylation.calculate_methylation_levels(methylation_data)

# Find differentially methylated regions
differential = methylation.find_differential_methylation(
    treatment_data,
    control_data,
    p_value_threshold=0.05
)

# Analyze promoter methylation
promoter_methylation = methylation.analyze_promoter_methylation(
    methylation_data,
    promoter_regions
)
```

### Chromatin Accessibility Pipeline
```python
from metainformant.epigenome import tracks

# Load ATAC-seq peaks
atac_peaks = tracks.load_atac_peaks("peaks.bed")

# Calculate accessibility metrics
accessibility_scores = tracks.calculate_accessibility(atac_peaks, genome_annotation)

# Identify transcription factor motifs
motifs = tracks.find_motifs_in_peaks(atac_peaks, motif_database="JASPAR")

# Compare accessibility between conditions
differential_accessibility = tracks.compare_accessibility(
    condition1_peaks,
    condition2_peaks
)
```

## Planned Extensions

Future epigenetic analysis modules will include:
- **Histone modifications**: ChIP-seq analysis for histone marks
- **DNA hydroxymethylation**: 5hmC analysis and mapping
- **RNA modifications**: epitranscriptomics analysis
- **3D genome structure**: Hi-C and chromatin conformation analysis
