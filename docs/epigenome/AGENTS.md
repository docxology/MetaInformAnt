# Agent Directives: docs/epigenome

## Role
Documentation for epigenomic analysis: methylation, ChIP-seq, and ATAC-seq.

## Contents
- DNA methylation analysis (bedGraph, beta values)
- Differentially methylated region (DMR) detection
- ChIP-seq peak analysis
- ATAC-seq chromatin accessibility
- Histone modification analysis

## Key Formats
- bedGraph for methylation values
- BED for genomic intervals
- narrowPeak/broadPeak for ChIP-seq peaks
