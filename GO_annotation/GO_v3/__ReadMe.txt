# Honey Bee (Apis mellifera) Tissue-specific RNA-seq Gene Expression Analysis README #

Welcome to the Honey Bee Tissue-specific RNA-seq Gene Expression Analysis pipeline!

This pipeline consists of four Python scripts designed to process and analyze gene expression data from honey bees. It helps to generate tissue-specific RNA-seq gene expression profiles using the amalgkit toolkit (https://github.com/kfuku52/amalgkit), integrating data from the NCBI SRA database and private FASTQ files.

This README file covers the functionality, inputs, and outputs of each script in the pipeline.

## Script Functionality

Script                  Functionality
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1_uniprot_ID_extract.py  Extracts UniProt IDs from a UniProt FASTA file
                         containing honey bee protein sequences.

2_genetogo.py            Maps UniProt IDs to their corresponding Gene
                         Ontology (GO) terms and generates a gene2go file.

3_genetogotoanno.py      Retrieves the descriptions of the GO terms and
                         generates a file containing gene ontology annotations.

4_genetogo_summary.py    Calculates summary statistics of the gene ontology
                         annotations and generates a summary text file.

## Description of each Script

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Script 1: 1_uniprot_ID_extract.py
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Functionality:
This script extracts UniProt IDs from a UniProt FASTA file containing protein sequences of honey bees. The output is a text file with one UniProt ID per line.

Input:
- uniprot_bees_proteome.fasta: A UniProt FASTA file containing honey bee protein sequences.

Output:
- bees_uniprot_ids.txt: A text file containing extracted UniProt IDs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Script 2: 2_genetogo.py
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Functionality:
This script downloads the necessary annotation files (Gene Ontology and gene association files) if they are not already present in the working directory. It then processes the gene association file to map UniProt IDs to their corresponding Gene Ontology (GO) terms and generates a gene2go file as output.

Input:
- bees_uniprot_ids.txt: A text file containing UniProt IDs.
- uniprot_bees_proteome.fasta: A UniProt FASTA file containing honey bee protein sequences.

Output:
- gene2go.txt: A text file containing UniProt IDs mapped to their corresponding GO terms.

Dependencies:
- BioPython
- goatools

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Script 3: 3_genetogotoanno.py
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Functionality:
This script reads the gene2go file generated by the second script and retrieves the descriptions of the GO terms using the downloaded Gene Ontology file. The output is a file containing gene ontology annotations, including UniProt IDs, GO terms, and their corresponding descriptions.

Input:
- gene2go.txt: A text file containing UniProt IDs mapped to their corresponding GO terms.

Output:
- gene_ontology_annotations.txt: A text file containing gene ontology annotations for the UniProt IDs, including GO terms and their descriptions.

Dependencies:
- pandas
- goatools

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Script 4: 4_genetogo_summary.py
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Functionality:
This script reads the gene ontology annotations file generated by the third script and calculates summary statistics, including the number of genes per GO term, the number of GO terms per gene, and the top 10 most common GO terms. The output is a text file containing the calculated summary information.

Input:
- gene_ontology_annotations.txt: A text file containing gene ontology annotations for the UniProt IDs, including GO terms and their descriptions.

Output:
- gene_go_annt_summary.txt: A text file containing summary statistics of the gene ontology annotations.

Dependencies:
- pandas
