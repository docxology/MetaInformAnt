# MetaInformAnt
 Integration for Ants and Beyond

Situation: 
- NCBI Taxon ID is the species identifier used for all genomics applications and pipelines (such as for genomic orthology inference or https://github.com/kfuku52/amalgkit for phylotranscriptomics)  
- Various kinds of information on Insects exists across various databases, for example related to genomics on NCBI https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/ as well as AntWiki https://www.antwiki.org, Global Ants Database http://globalants.org/, AntWeb https://www.antweb.org/, AntCat https://www.antcat.org/, CESTES https://icestes.github.io/database, AntMaps https://antmaps.org/?, AntBase http://antbase.org/, FORMIS http://www.ars.usda.gov/saa/cmave/ifahi/formis, and others)
- Our initial focus here is on the Hymenoptera https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hymenoptera -- the ants, bees, wasps, and sawflies. The Hymenoptera have a global distribution and include many important, interesting, and lovable species. There are 150,000+ Hymenopteran species, and the study of the field is relatively mature, reflected by a Hymenoptera Anatomy Ontology http://portal.hymao.org/projects/32/public/ontology/ and many behavioral/genomic studies. Areas of information on Ants include natural history, behavior, morphological, literature.

Mission: 
- To integrate biological information on ants and other species.
