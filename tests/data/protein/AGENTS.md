# Agent Directives: tests/data/protein

## Role
Protein structure and sequence test fixtures.

## Contents
Test data for:
- Protein sequence alignment (FASTA format)
- Structure file parsing (PDB format)
- Domain annotation validation
- UniProt/InterPro integration testing

## Rules
- Protein sequences must use standard amino acid codes
- PDB files must follow PDB format specification
- Include realistic protein families for alignment testing
