# MetaInformAnt TODO

> **Last Updated**: 2026-07-25
>
> This TODO contains only active unfinished work. Prior BeeWAS GWAS,
> manuscript, dashboard, validation, and release-bundle work is recorded in
> status notes and generated release artifacts, not in this active list.

The Hymenoptera Amalgkit project has a separate, data-root-scoped backlog at
[`projects/hymenoptera_amalgkit/TODO.md`](projects/hymenoptera_amalgkit/TODO.md).
Keep that work there rather than mixing a live external-volume transcriptome
campaign with the BeeWAS release backlog below. Completed MetaInformAnt RNA
and Hymenoptera implementation work is intentionally absent from both active
lists; its evidence is maintained in the project status and readiness records.

## Current Scope

BeeWAS four-population statistical GWAS reporting is operational for the
combined cohort and population scopes `C`, `I`, `M`, and `R`. Manuscript
rendering, visual QA, artifact indexing, guarded dashboard generation, GO
curation-atlas outputs, statistical deep-dive summaries, and release packaging
are generated and validated. The active work below is evidence-gated: it
requires human-approved metadata, human-reviewed GO mapping decisions, or
independent replication evidence before the repository can mark the item
complete.

Use the package-module sweep to refresh status after any evidence is supplied:

```bash
cd /Users/mini/Documents/GitHub/MetaInformAntCode/MetaInformAnt/projects/apis_gwas
uv run python -m beewas.gwas.review_release build
```

## Minor Updates

- [ ] **Finalize BeeWAS manuscript metadata** - Complete
  `projects/apis_gwas/doc/manuscript/renderable/final_metadata_intake.tsv`
  with final title, authors, affiliations, corresponding author, funding,
  contributions, conflicts, data availability, code availability, reviewer
  name, review date, and final status values. Current status is tracked in
  `projects/apis_gwas/output/pdf/beewas_gwas/manuscript_metadata_status.tsv`.

## Medium Improvements

- [ ] **Review BeeWAS GO mapping evidence** - Review
  `projects/apis_gwas/doc/operations/reviews/gwas_reviewed_go_mapping_intake_template.tsv`,
  set justified rows to `review_status=reviewed`, retain provenance fields, and
  ingest the reviewed TSV with `uv run python -m beewas.gwas.reviewed_go ingest
  path/to/reviewed_go.tsv`. Current intake status is tracked in
  `projects/apis_gwas/results/gwas_79cram_clean_reviewed_fullgemma_guarded_20260624_summary/tables/gwas_reviewed_go_mapping_intake_status.tsv`.

## Major Improvements

- [ ] **Supply independent replication evidence** - Complete
  `projects/apis_gwas/doc/operations/reviews/gwas_replication_review_scaffold.tsv`
  with external cohort details, comparable trait definitions, model
  compatibility, evidence URIs, reviewer decisions, reviewer names, and review
  dates before any replication claim is made.

---

## Operating Rules

- Use package-module commands for BeeWAS work, for example
  `uv run python -m beewas.gwas.guarded ...`.
- Keep runtime outputs under `output/`, `results/`, or documented data/output
  directories.
- For the live Hymenoptera cloud campaign, reattach an interrupted controller
  with `--skip-bundle-upload` and the original state/source/input IDs; never
  rebuild or overwrite an immutable source object under an existing run ID.
- Do not convert curation evidence into biological, causal, gene-function,
  replication, breeding, or final heritability claims without a reviewed
  decision artifact.
- Keep this TODO forward-looking; move resolved evidence and dated snapshots to
  the appropriate status or release document.
